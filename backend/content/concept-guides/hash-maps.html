    <p>
        Hash tables are one of the most frequently used data structures in technical interviews. Always consider them
        when first analyzing a question.
    </p>
    <p>
        A hash table is a data structure that allows you to store data and access it using a key. The key and the data
        can be any data structure.
    </p>
    <p class=${styles.boldPoint}>A Hash table contains sets of key value pairs.</p>
    <p>
        At a high level, a hash table utilizes an array. Each key corresponds to an index in the array where the data is
        stored. The hash function is responsible for converting the key into the index.
    </p>
    <p class=${styles.highlight}>A Hash Table has 2 parts, an array and a hash function</p>
    <p>
        The array stores the data, and the hash function tells us as what index to store it and, later, at what index we
        can access it.
    </p>
    <h2>Hash Functions</h2>
    <p>A hash function creates the mapping between a key and a value. It takes the value as an input, places it in the
        array, and returns the key to access it. Let's make a key distinction here: the key for a value is not the same
        as its index in the array. Different hash functions are different mapping algorithms.
    </p>
    <p> We pass the key, and the hash function maps from the key to what's called a hash code and from the hash code to
        the index in the array.
    </p>
    <p>
        If a value with the same key is placed at an index, we simply update the existing value for that key to match
        the new one.
    </p>
    <p class=${styles.boldPoint}>Ultimately, the usability of a hash table to solve a store and look-up problem hinges
        on how good of a hash function the hash table has.</p>
