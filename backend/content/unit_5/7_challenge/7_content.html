    <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
    <p>
      Given an <code>m x n</code> 2D binary grid <code>grid</code> which
      represents a map of <code>'1's</code> (land) and
      <code>'0's</code> (water), return the number of islands.
    </p>
    <p>
      An <strong>island</strong> is surrounded by water and is formed by
      connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all
      four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.
