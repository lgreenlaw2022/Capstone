  <h1>Concept Guide: Graph Traversal</h1>
  <section>
    <p>
      Graph traversal is the process of visiting (checking and/or updating) each
      vertex in a graph. Traversals can help search for nodes or collect data on
      characteristics of the graph. Unlike linear data structures that have
      exactly one logical way to traverse them, graphs can be traversed in
      multiple ways depending on the starting vertex and traversal strategy. The
      two primary graph traversal strategies are Depth-First Search (DFS) and
      Breadth-First Search (BFS).
    </p>

    <h2>Depth-First Search (DFS)</h2>
    <p>
      Depth-First Search is a traversal algorithm that explores as deeply as
      possible along each branch before backtracking. Think of it as exploring a
      maze by following a path until you reach a dead end, then backtracking to
      the last intersection to try another path.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>How DFS Works:</strong>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Start at a chosen vertex (root)</li>
      <li>Explore one of its unvisited neighbors</li>
      <li>
        Continue exploring deeper from that neighbor before exploring any other
        neighbors of the original vertex
      </li>
      <li>
        When reaching a vertex with no unvisited neighbors, backtrack to the
        last vertex with unexplored paths
      </li>
      <li>
        Repeat until all vertices reachable from the starting vertex are visited
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      DFS is suited for detecting cycles in a graph and pathfinding. However,
      DFS is not guaranteed to find the shortest path to a node because of its
      depth-first approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      DFS can be implemented either recursively (using the system's call stack)
      or iteratively (using an explicit stack data structure). The recursive
      implementation is often more elegant and easier to understand. The below
      code shows how to traverse an adjacency matrix or an adjacency list graph
      representation.
    </p>
    <p>Adjacency list:</p>
    <pre><code class="codeBlock"># DFS implementation using adjacency list with hashmaps (recursive)
    def dfs(graph, start, visited=None):
        """Recursive DFS on an adjacency list"""
        # Initialize visited set on first call
        if visited is None:
            visited = set()
        
        # Mark current vertex as visited
        visited.add(start)
        print(f"Visited vertex: {start}")
        
        # Explore all adjacent vertices
        for neighbor in graph.adj_dict[start]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                # Recursive call for unvisited neighbor
                dfs(graph, neighbor, visited)
        
        return visited</code></pre>
    <p>Adjacency matrix:</p>
    <pre><code class="codeBlock">def traverse(matrix, i, j, visited):
        """Recursive DFS traversal for a 2D adjacency matrix."""
        if (i, j) in visited or matrix[i][j] == 0:  # Avoid revisiting and skip non-edges
            return

        visited.add((i, j))
        print(f"Visited vertex: ({i}, {j})")

        directions = ((0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0))  # Right, Left, Down, Up
        for di, dj in directions:
            next_i, next_j = i + di, j + dj
            # ensure that the neighbor is within the matrix
            if 0 &lt;= next_i &lt; len(matrix) and 0 &lt;= next_j &lt; len(matrix[0]):
                traverse(matrix, next_i, next_j, visited)
    
    def dfs(matrix):
        """Performs DFS on a 2D adjacency matrix."""
        if not matrix or not matrix[0]:
            return []
    
        visited = set()
    
        # Start DFS from the first vertex found (assuming top-left as start)
        for i in range(len(matrix)):
            for j in range(len(matrix[0])):
                if matrix[i][j] == 1 and (i, j) not in visited:
                    traverse(matrix, i, j, visited)
    
        return visited</code></pre>
    <p>
      Note that for all these traversal methods, it's important to track the
      visited nodes to ensure you do not get caught in a cycle.

    <h2>Breadth-First Search (BFS)</h2>
    <p>
      Breadth-First Search is a traversal algorithm that explores all vertices
      at the present depth before moving on to vertices at the next depth level.
      Think of it as exploring a maze by examining all possible paths one step
      away, then all possible paths two steps away, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      This approach is commonly used to find the guaranteed shortest path in
      unweighted graphs.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>How BFS Works:</strong>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Start at a chosen vertex (root)</li>
      <li>Explore all of its neighbors</li>
      <li>For each of those neighbors, explore their unexplored neighbors</li>
      <li>Continue level by level, moving outward from the starting vertex</li>
    </ol>
    <p>BFS is typically implemented using a queue data structure:</p>
    <p>Adjacency List:</p>
    <pre><code class="codeBlock">from collections import deque
  
    def bfs(graph, start):
        """Performs BFS on an adjacency list."""
        visited = set([start])  # Track visited vertices
        queue = deque([start])  # Initialize queue with starting vertex
        
        while queue:  # Continue while queue is not empty
            # Dequeue a vertex from the front of the queue
            vertex = queue.popleft()
            print(f"Visited vertex: {vertex}")
            
            # Explore all adjacent vertices
            for neighbor in graph.adj_dict[vertex]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    visited.add(neighbor)
                    queue.append(neighbor)  # Enqueue unvisited neighbors
        
        return visited</code></pre>

    <p>Adjacency Matrix:</p>
    <pre><code class="codeBlock">def bfs(matrix):
    """Performs BFS on a 2D adjacency matrix."""
    if not matrix or not matrix[0]:
        return []

    visited = set()
    queue = deque()
    directions = ((0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0))  # Right, Left, Down, Up

    # Start BFS from the first vertex found (assuming top-left as start)
    for i in range(len(matrix)):
        for j in range(len(matrix[0])):
            if matrix[i][j] == 1 and (i, j) not in visited:
                queue.append((i, j))
                visited.add((i, j))

                while queue:
                    x, y = queue.popleft()
                    print(f"Visited vertex: ({x}, {y})")

                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        next_x, next_y = x + dx, y + dy
                        # ensure that the neighbor is within the matrix bounds
                        if (0 &lt;= next_x &lt; len(matrix) and 0 &lt;= next_y &lt; len(matrix[0]) and 
                            matrix[next_x][next_y] == 1 and (next_x, next_y) not in visited):
                            queue.append((next_x, next_y))
                            visited.add((next_x, next_y))

    return visited</code></pre>

    <h2>Topological Sort</h2>
    <p>
      Topological sorting is a specialized graph traversal applicable only to
      Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). It produces a linear ordering of the
      vertices such that for every directed edge (u, v), vertex u comes before
      vertex v in the ordering. See the image below for an example. If the graph
      contains a cycle, a topological sort is impossible. Note that there can be
      multiple valid orderings of nodes from a topological sort.
    </p>
    <img
      src="/assets/figures/topological-sort.png"
      alt="graph converted to topological sort"
      style="width: 650px; height: auto"
    />
    <p>
      The most common implementation of topological sort uses a modified DFS
      algorithm.
    </p>
    <strong>How Topological Sort Works:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Perform DFS on unvisited nodes.</li>
      <li>After visiting all neighbors of a node, push it onto a stack.</li>
      <li>The final order is obtained by popping elements from the stack.</li>
    </ul>
    <pre><code class="codeBlock">def topological_sort_dfs(graph):
    """Performs topological sort on a directed acyclic graph (DAG) using DFS."""
    visited = set()
    stack = []

    def dfs(node):
        """Recursive DFS function that pushes nodes onto the stack after visiting all neighbors."""
        if node in visited:
            return
        visited.add(node)

        for neighbor in graph.get(node, []):
            if neighbor not in visited:
                dfs(neighbor)

        stack.append(node)  # Push to stack after visiting all neighbors

    # Perform DFS from all unvisited nodes
    for node in graph:
        if node not in visited:
            dfs(node)

    return stack[::-1]  # Reverse stack to get topological order</code></pre>

    <h2>Complexity</h2>
    <p>
      The complexity of operations depends on which graph representation you
      use.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Adjacency List: O(V + E)</strong></p>
    <p>
      Each vertex is visited once, resulting in linear time complexity because,
      in the adjacency list, you're only iterating through actual edges rather
      than all possible vertex pairs.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Adjacency Matrix: O(VÂ²)</strong></p>
    <p>
      In both DFS and BFS, every vertex will potentially examine all other
      vertices, leading to quadratic time complexity.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Topological Sort</strong></p>
    <p>The time complexity of topological sort is the same as DFS.</p>

      <li>
        Breadth-first traversal visits each vertex&apos;s immediate neighbors
        before examining the vertex&apos;s at the next depth.
      </li>
      <li>
        DFS is usually completed with recursion using a stack while BFS is

      <li>
        Topological sort is a method of sorting DAG vertices where every vertex
        comes before the vertices it points to in the ordering.
