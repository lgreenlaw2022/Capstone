  <h1>Concept Guide: Graphs</h1>
  <section>
    <p>
      Graphs are a data structure consisting of vertices (or nodes) and edges
      connecting them. Each vertex in a graph represents an entity, and edges
      represent the relationships or connections between these entities. Unlike
      linear data structures such as arrays or linked lists, graphs can express
      more complex relationships between data points.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Graph Vocabulary</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Vertex/Node:</strong> an entity in a graph that can store data
        and be connected to other vertices.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Edge:</strong> a connection between two vertices, representing a
        relationship.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Adjacent Vertices:</strong> vertices that are connected by an
        edge.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Path:</strong> a sequence of vertices where each adjacent pair
        is connected by an edge.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cycle:</strong> a path that starts and ends at the same vertex.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Connected Graph:</strong> a graph where there is a path between
        every pair of vertices.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Complete Graph:</strong> a graph where there is an edge between
        every pair of vertices.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Degree:</strong> the number of edges connected to a vertex.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We began learning about nonlinear data structures with binary trees. Trees
      are actually a specific type of graph with additional constraints:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Each node has at most one parent.</li>
      <li>There are no cycles in the tree.</li>
      <li>Trees have a hierarchical structure with a root node.</li>
      <li>There is exactly one path between any two nodes.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In contrast, graphs:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Can have multiple edges between vertices.</li>
      <li>Can have cycles.</li>
      <li>Do not have a root node.</li>
      <li>Can have multiple paths between nodes.</li>
      <li>Can be directed or undirected.</li>
      <li>
        Can have any number of edges, up to (n(n-1))/2 for an undirected graph
        with n vertices
      </li>
    </ul>

    />

    <p><strong>Real-life Example: Social Networks</strong></p>
    <p>
      A social network is a perfect example of a graph in action. In this
      scenario:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Each person is a vertex.</li>
      <li>Friendship connections are edges.</li>
      <li>Groups of friends form clusters or subgraphs.</li>
      <li>Information can spread through the network like a virus.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For instance, if Alice is friends with Bob and Charlie, and Bob and
      Charlie are also friends with Diana, the system might suggest Diana as a
      friend for Alice. This recommendation is essentially finding vertices that
      are two edges away from a given vertex.
    </p>
    <p>Social networks often implement graph algorithms to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Recommend friends or connections.</li>
      <li>Identify clusters or communities.</li>
      <li>Find the shortest path between two users.</li>
      <li>Identify influencers or key players in the network.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Types of Graphs</h2>
    <p><strong>Undirected Graphs</strong></p>
    <p>
      In undirected graphs, edges have no direction. If vertex A is connected to
      vertex B, then B is also connected to A.
    </p>
    <p>
      Real-world example: Friendship on Facebook (if you're friends with
      someone, they're friends with you)
    </p>
    <p><strong>Directed Graphs</strong></p>
    <p>
      In directed graphs (also known as digraphs), edges have a direction. If
      vertex A is connected to vertex B, it does not imply that B is connected
      to A.
    </p>
    <p>
      Real-world example: Twitter followers (you can follow someone without them
      following you back)
    </p>
    <strong>Weighted Graphs</strong>
    <p>
      Weighted graphs assign a numerical weight to each edge. These weights can
      represent distances, costs, or any other value associated with the
      connection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Real-world example: A map with distances between cities (edges represent
      roads, and weights represent the distance between cities)
    </p>
    <strong>Other Specialized Types</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Complete Graph: Every vertex is connected to every other vertex.</li>
      <li>
        Bipartite Graph: Vertices can be divided into two groups such that no
        vertices within the same group are adjacent.
      </li>
      <li>DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph): A directed graph with no cycles</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Graph Representations</h2>
    <section>
      <h3>Theoretical Representation</h3>
      <p>Mathematically, a graph G is represented as G = (V, E), where:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>V</strong> is the set of vertices</li>
        <li>
          <strong>E</strong> is the set of edges, each typically defined as a
          pair of vertices (u, v)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>For example, a simple undirected graph might be represented as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>V</strong> = {1, 2, 3, 4}</li>
        <li><strong>E</strong> = {(1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,4)}</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This denotes a graph with 4 vertices and 4 edges, where vertex 1 is
        connected to vertices 2 and 3, vertex 2 is connected to vertices 1 and
        3, and so on.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Practical Representations</h3>
      <p>
        There are several ways to represent graphs in code, each with its own
        advantages and drawbacks.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>1. Adjacency Matrix</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        An adjacency matrix is a 2D array of size VÃ—V, where V is the number of
        vertices. For an unweighted graph:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>matrix[i][j] = 1 if there is an edge from vertex i to vertex j</li>
        <li>matrix[i][j] = 0 if there is no edge</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For weighted graphs, instead of 1, we store the weight of the edge.</p>
      <pre><code class="codeBlock">class AdjacencyMatrixGraph:
    def __init__(self, num_vertices):
        self.num_vertices = num_vertices
        # Initialize adjacency matrix with zeros
        self.adj_matrix = [[0 for _ in range(num_vertices)] for _ in range(num_vertices)]

    def add_edge(self, u, v, weight=1):
        # Add edge from u to v (and v to u for undirected graph)
        self.adj_matrix[u][v] = weight
        self.adj_matrix[v][u] = weight  # Remove this line for directed graph

    def remove_edge(self, u, v):
        self.adj_matrix[u][v] = 0
        self.adj_matrix[v][u] = 0  # Remove this line for directed graph</code></pre>
      <strong>Advantages</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Simple and intuitive representation</li>
        <li>Efficient for dense graphs with many connections</li>
        <li>Constant-time edge lookup</li>
      </ul>
      <strong>Disadvantages</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Memory-intensive for sparse graphs</li>
        <li>Space complexity of O(V^2)</li>
        <li>Adding or removing vertices is expensive</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <strong>2. Adjacency List</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        An adjacency list uses an array of lists, where each list describes the
        set of neighbors of a vertex. Adjacency lists are often expressed using
        hash maps or a list of lists.
      </p>
      <pre><code class="codeBlock">class AdjacencyListGraph:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize empty dictionary
        self.adj_dict = {}
    
    def add_vertex(self, vertex):
        if vertex not in self.adj_dict:
            self.adj_dict[vertex] = {}
    
    def add_edge(self, u, v, weight=1):
        # Add vertices if they don't exist
        self.add_vertex(u)
        self.add_vertex(v)
        
        # Add edges with weights
        self.adj_dict[u][v] = weight
        self.adj_dict[v][u] = weight  # Remove for directed graph
    
    def remove_edge(self, u, v):
        if u in self.adj_dict and v in self.adj_dict[u]:
            del self.adj_dict[u][v]
            del self.adj_dict[v][u]  # Remove for directed graph
    
    def remove_vertex(self, vertex):
        # Remove all edges connected to this vertex
        if vertex in self.adj_dict:
            # Get all neighbors before removing
            neighbors = list(self.adj_dict[vertex].keys())
            # Remove edges from neighbors to this vertex
            for neighbor in neighbors:
                if vertex in self.adj_dict[neighbor]:
                    del self.adj_dict[neighbor][vertex]
            # Remove the vertex itself
            del self.adj_dict[vertex]</code></pre>
      <p><strong>Advantages</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Space complexity is O(V+E), efficient for sparse graphs</li>
        <li>Adding a vertex is easier than with adjacency matrix</li>
        <li>Iterating over all edges of a vertex is efficient</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Disadvantages</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Edge lookup is O(degree(V)), which can be O(V) in the worst case
        </li>
        <li>More complex to implement than adjacency matrix</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <strong>3. Edge List</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Edge list is simply a list of all edges in the graph. Where the tuple
        (u, v) represents that vertex u has a connection with v. If the edge is
        directed, u points to v. The weight can also be added as an additional
        value to each edge pair.
      </p>
      <pre><code class="codeBlock">class EdgeListGraph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.edges = []
        self.vertices = set()
    
    def add_edge(self, u, v, weight=1):
        self.vertices.add(u)
        self.vertices.add(v)
        self.edges.append((u, v, weight))   
      </code></pre>
      <p><strong>Advantages</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Simple to implement</li>
        <li>Good for algorithms that operate on edges directly</li>
        <li>Memory efficient for sparse graphs</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Disadvantages</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Finding all edges connected to a vertex is inefficient</li>
        <li>Edge lookup requires scanning the entire list</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>Complexity</h2>
    <p>
      The complexity of operations depends on which graph representation you
      use.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Space Complexity</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Adjacency Matrix</strong>: O(VÂ²) space, where V is the number of
        vertices
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Adjacency List (Array or Hashmap)</strong>: O(V + E) space,
        where E is the number of edges
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Edge List</strong>: O(E) space, where E is the number of edges
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Time Complexity</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Edge Lookup</strong>:
        <ul>
          <li>Adjacency Matrix: O(1)</li>
          <li>
            Adjacency List with Arrays: O(degree(v)) which can be O(V) in worst
            case. For each vertex, the list of neighbors must be iterated over
            to find an edge.
          </li>
          <li>
            Adjacency List with Hash maps: O(1) for checking if edge exists.
            Hash maps allow constant-time edge lookups due to efficient hashing.
          </li>
          <li>
            Edge List: O(E) To check if an edge exists, the entire edge list
            must be scanned
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Finding all neighbors</strong>:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Adjacency Matrix: O(V), you need to check all V possible edges to
            find its neighbors
          </li>
          <li>
            Adjacency List (Array or Hashmap): O(degree(v)), you only need to
            check the neighbors of the vertex
          </li>
          <li>Edge List: O(E)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>
