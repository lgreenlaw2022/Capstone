    <h1>Recognition Guide: Hash Maps</h1>
    <p>
        <strong>Signs you may want to use a hash map</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>
                You need to store values
            </li>
            <li>
                You need constant run time but storage is not restricted
            </li>
            <li>
                You want to count occurrences 
            </li>
        </ol>
        <strong>Common problems that use hash maps:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Finding duplicates</li>
            <li>Finding a sum</li>
            <li>Remove the least recently used (LRU) item</li>
            <li>Mapping one input to another</li>
            <li>Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong><i>Do not use if:</i></strong>
        <ol>
            <li>the order of the data matters</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    
    <h2>Questions to ask in an interview</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Are there any memory constraints?
                <ul>
                    <li>Hash tables can be space-inefficient due to the need for resizing and handling collisions. It's vital to understand if space efficiency is a critical factor.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Do you require a specific time complexity?
                <ul>
                    <li>Asking for specific run time requirements, like needing constant time complexity (O(1)) for insertions, deletions, and lookups, can signal a hash table is appropriate.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Can you describe the nature of the data items you are dealing with?
                <ul>
                    <li>Understanding whether the data items are complex objects, simple key-value pairs, or require relationships between items can help infer the operations needed.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>
