  <h1>Concept Guide: Hash Sets</h1>
  <p>
    A hash set is similar to a hash table. A hash set is a collection of unique
    objects rather than key-value pairs. A hash set internally uses the hash
    table data structure to store data items. A key difference is that sets
    cannot contain duplicate items. Because hash sets use hash functions, they
    have the same run time advantages: constant time lookups and storing
    operations. Hash sets are useful when you only want to store unique values.
  </p>
  <h2>Python implementation</h2>
  <p>
    A Python set is a hash set. The set data structure is mutable because we can
    add or remove elements. However, the values are not mutable meaning we
    cannot update or change its value later. Adding, removing, and accessing a
    value in the set can be completed in constant time. Like dictionaries,
    python sets can contain a mix of data types.

  <p>
    A common way to use a set in a technical interview is for problems that
    require checking for duplicates. In this case, you can compare the length of
    the original data (eg. list) with the length of that data in a set.
