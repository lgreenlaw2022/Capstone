  <h1>Concept Guide: Binary Trees</h1>
  <p>
    Binary trees are most commonly used as Binary Search Trees which will be
    introduced later in this unit. We’ll start with a foundation in Binary
    Trees. A binary tree is a data structure that starts with a root node and
    every node can have up to two children. If there are no child nodes, the
    left and right children point to null. Nodes with no children are referred
    to as leaf nodes.

  <p>In python, each node of the tree can be represented as an object.</p>
  <pre><code class="codeBlock language-python">class TreeNode():
  def __init__(self, value=None, left=None, right=None):
    self.value = value
    self.left = left
    self.right = right</code></pre>

  <p>Other important vocabulary includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>order (of node or tree): </strong>a position in a list that
      contains the value of whatever is stored at the position as well as at
      least one reference to another node.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>depth of a node: </strong>number of edges from the node to the
      tree's root node. A root node has a depth of 0.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>height of a node: </strong>number of edges on the longest
      path from the node to a leaf. A leaf node has a height of 0.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The height and depth <i>of a tree</i> are equivalent. The height of a tree
    is the height of its root node and equivalently, the depth of its deepest
    node. Because each node can have at most two children, the height of a
    <i>balanced</i>
    binary tree is O(log n) where n is the number of nodes in the tree.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Real-life Example</strong></p>
  <p>
    An example of a binary tree in real life is a decision tree where are two
    choices to follow at each path. Below is an example of a decision tree for
    buying a car. We see that the outcome of yes or no for the attribute leads
    to 1, 2, or 0 children at the leaf nodes. Binary trees are structured
    similarly, where each node holds data, and depending on the goal of the
    problem, we might choose to follow the left or right child node.

  <p><strong>Categories of Binary Trees</strong></p>
  <p>
    Binary Trees can be classified into types based on multiple factors. These
    categories are important to understand as you may be asked to evaluate or
    use a specific type of tree in an interview question.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Full binary tree</strong>: every node has 0 or 2 children</li>
    <li>
      <strong>Degenerate binary tree</strong>: every parent node has only one
      child node. This tree is effectively a linked list.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Skewed binary tree</strong>: a specific class of degenerate binary
      trees. The tree only has left nodes (left-skewed) or right nodes
      (right-skewed).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Complete binary tree</strong>: every level of the tree is fully
      filled except possibly for the last level. The last level is filled from
      left to right.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Perfect binary tree</strong>: all internal nodes have 2 children
      and all the leaf nodes are at the same depth.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Balanced binary tree</strong>: the height of the left and right
      subtrees of every node differs by at most 1.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Traversing a Binary Tree</h2>
  <p>
    There are multiple ways to traverse binary trees. Choosing the right
    traversal is critical to solving a problem efficiently. The traversal
    methods can be divided into two categories: Depth First Search (DFS) and
    Breadth First Search (BFS).
  </p>
  <p><strong>Depth First Search Traversal Methods</strong></p>
  <p><strong>1. Preorder: root-left-right</strong></p>
  <p>
    This strategy is root first. Each root node is processed before it’s
    children are. The left child nodes are then traversed before the right child
    nodes. This strategy is helpful when you want to copy a tree.
  </p>
  <pre><code class="codeBlock">def printPreorder(node):
  if node:
    print(node.value)
    # traverse left subtree
    printPreorder(node.left)
    # traverse right subtree
    printPreorder(node.right)</code></pre>

  <p><strong>2. Inorder: left-root-right</strong></p>
  <p>
    This is the most commonly used and arguably the most important traversal
    method. An in order traversal first visits the left nodes, then the root
    node, and then the right nodes. This traversal works from the bottom up:
    leaf nodes to root node. This is a valuable strategy for Binary Search Trees
    (introduced next) because it returns the nodes in sorted order.
  </p>
  <pre><code class="codeBlock">def printInorder(node):
  if node:
    # traverse left subtree
    printInorder(node.left)
    print(node.value)
    # traverse right subtree
    printInorder(node.right)</code></pre>

  <p><strong>3. Postorder: left-right-root</strong></p>
  <p>
    This strategy is root last. Each root node is processed after it’s children
    are. The left child nodes are traversed before the right child nodes. This
    strategy is helpful when you want to delete a tree. It is also a bottom-up
    strategy; use this for problems where you want to inspect the leaves first.
  </p>
  <pre><code class="codeBlock">def printPostorder(node):
  if node:
    # traverse left subtree
    printPostorder(node.left)
    # traverse right subtree
    printPostorder(node.right)
    print(node.value)</code></pre>

  <p><strong>Breadth First Search Method</strong></p>
  <p><strong>4. Level Order</strong></p>
  <p>
    In this strategy, all the nodes on the same level are traversed before their
    children; a top down approach. This is a useful method when searching for a
    node that satisfies a specific property or you know the desired node will
    likely be in the top levels of the tree. This is most commonly implemented
    iteratively, rather than the recursive approaches above.
  </p>
  <pre><code class="codeBlock">from collections import deque
def printLevelOrder(root):
  queue = deque()
  if (root == None):
      return
  # add root to queue
  queue.append(root)
  while queue:
      node = queue.popleft()
      print(node.value)
      # add left child to end of queue
      if(node.left != None): queue.append(node.left)
      # add right child to end of queue
      if(node.right != None): queue.append(node.right)</code></pre>

    This graphic shows how each traversal would progress through the binary
    tree.

  <p><strong>Traversal Runtimes</strong></p>
  <p>
    Every method has an O(n) runtime where n is the number of nodes because each
    node is visited once.
  </p>

  <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
  <ul>
