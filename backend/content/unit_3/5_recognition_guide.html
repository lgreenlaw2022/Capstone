    <h1>Recognition Guide: Binary Trees

    <div>
        <strong>Signs you may want to use binary trees</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Use cases of binary trees include graph problems, routing, and decision trees
            </li>
            <li>
                BSTs are useful in situations where you want efficient search operations
            </li>
        </ol>

        <div>
            <strong><i>Do not use if:</i></strong>
            <ol>
                <li>Storing data in an array would be less complex</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <strong>Deciding between traversal strategies</strong>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Use a depth-first search if you want to explore as far as possible along each branch before backtracking
            </li>
            <li>
                Use pre-order traversal if you want to copy the tree
            </li>
            <li>
                Use post-order traversal if you want to delete the tree.
            </li>
            <li>
                Use in-order traversal if you want to get the sorted order of elements from a BST
            </li>
            <li>
                Use level order traversal when you want to search for a node that satisfies a specific property
            </li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <h2>Questions to ask in an interview</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Can I assume the tree is balanced or complete?
                <ul>
                    <li>This question is important for clarifying the run time of certain operations</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                What kind of tree is it? Binary tree? BST?
            </li>
            <li>
                Can the tree be empty?
            </li>
            <li>
                Do we know the order in which elements are added to the tree?
                <ul>
                    <li>This can also provide insight into the height of a tree. For example, if you have a mostly sorted array, a BST is going to be right skewed. In this case, it may be better not to use a tree. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Is the input array sorted?
                <ul>
                    As described in the previous question, we may opt to not use a tree when building it from a mostly sorted array. Only build BSTs when you need the lookup advantages. 
                </ul>>
            </li>
        </ol>
