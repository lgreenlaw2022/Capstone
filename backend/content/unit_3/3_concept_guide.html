  <h1>Concept Guide: Binary Search Trees</h1>
  <p>
    Binary search trees (BSTs) are one of the most commonly used binary trees.
    BSTs are binary trees where every left child has a value less than the
    parent node and every right child has a value greater than the parent node.
    This results in a recursive structure where every left and right subtree
    must also be a binary search tree. This structure leads to efficient
    searching, insertion, and deletion operations. The figure below is a BST.
    Observe how the smallest value in the tree is the leftmost node and the
    largest value in the tree is the rightmost node. This data structure is
    helpful for storing data in a sorted order.

    To retrieve the elements in ascending order from a BST, we can perform an
    in-order traversal. In-order traversals examine the left child, the root
    node, and then the right child. The resulting sorted array is what gives this traversal
    method its name.
