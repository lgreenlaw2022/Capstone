  <h1>Concept Guide: Binary Search Trees</h1>
  <p>
    Binary search trees (BSTs) are one of the most commonly used binary trees.
    BSTs are binary trees where every left child has a value less than the
    parent node and every right child has a value greater than the parent node.
    This results in a recursive structure where every left and right subtree
    must also be a binary search tree. This structure leads to efficient
    searching, insertion, and deletion operations. The figure below is a BST.
    Observe how the smallest value in the tree is the leftmost node and the
    largest value in the tree is the rightmost node. This data structure is
    helpful for storing data in a sorted order.

  <p>
    To retrieve the elements in ascending order from a BST, we can perform an
    in-order traversal. In-order traversals examine the left child, the root
    node, and then the right child. The resulting sorted array is what gives
    this traversal method its name.
  </p>

  <h2>Common Operations</h2>
  <h3>Insertion</h3>
  <p>
    A new item is always added as a leaf node. To determine its placement, we
    use the rules of BSTs to traverse down from the root until the value can be
    added as a child of a leaf node. Below is the code demonstrating insertion.
  </p>
  <pre><code class="codeBlock">class Node:
  def __init__(self, val):
      self.val = val
      self.left = None
      self.right = None

def insert(node, val):
    # If the tree is empty, return a new node
    if node is None:
        return Node(val)

    # Otherwise, recur down the tree
    if val &lt; node.val:
        node.left = insert(node.left, val)
    elif val &gt; node.val:
        node.right = insert(node.right, val)

    return node
    </code></pre>
  <p><strong>Complexity</strong></p>
  <p>
    In a balanced tree, the height of the left and right subtree of any node do
    not differ by more than one. Most BST problems begin with a series of
    insertions to build the tree. Given the order of the values, its possible
    the result is an unbalanced tree. Note, there are self-balancing binary
    trees that adjust after each insertion or deletion to maintain a height of
    O(log(n)). These include AVL trees and Red Black trees.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the best case scenario, the tree is perfectly balanced. Worst case, the
    tree is completely skewed. In the average case, the tree is balanced.
    Inserting a single node in a balanced tree of height O(log(n)) takes
    O(log(n)) time. Thus, the time to build a tree is O(n log(n)) as every node
    must be inserted. In the worst case, each insertion takes O(n) time.
  </p>

  <h2>Search</h2>
  <p>
    BSTs are an ideal data structure for searching. Start at the root node and
    traverse down. Given a balanced tree, for each node we examine, we can
    eliminate the left or right subtree until the desired node is found. Below
    is the code for searching a BST.
  </p>
  <pre><code class="codeBlock">def search(root, val):
    # Base Case: root is null or val is present at root
    if root is None or root.val == val:
        return root

    # val is greater than root's val
    if root.val &lt; val:
        return search(root.right, val)

    # val is smaller than root's val
    return search(root.left, val)
  </code></pre>
  <p><strong>Complexity</strong></p>
  <p>
    Similar to insertion, the complexity is O(h) where h is the height of the
    tree. The best case scenario is when the node is the root: O(1). Otherwise,
    on average the complexity is O(log(n))
  </p>

  <h2>Deletion</h2>
  <p>
    There are three possible cases that may occur when trying to delete a node.
    It could be a leaf node, have one child, or two children. In every case, you
    must search for the node first.
  </p>
  <p>
    <ol>
      <li>If it is a leaf node, we can simply delete it.</li>
      <li>
        If it has one child, we can replace the node with its child.
      </li>
      <li>
        If it has two children, we must find the nodeâ€™s in-order successor. This
        is the smallest node in the right subtree. We then replace the node with
        the in-order successor and delete the in-order successor. This is shown in the screenshot below.
    </ol>
    <p class="highlight">
      In-order successor: The next greatest value in the tree. The in-order successor is the leftmost node in the right subtree.
    </p>

    />
  </p>
  <p>
    Below is the code for deleting a node in a BST.
  </p>
  <pre><code class="codeBlock">def delete_node(root, val):
    if root is None:
        return root

    # Find the node to be deleted
    if val &lt; root.val:
        root.left = delete_node(root.left, key)
    elif val &gt; root.val:
        root.right = delete_node(root.right, key)
    else:
        # Node with only one child or no child
        if root.left is None:
            return root.right
        elif root.right is None:
            return root.left

        # Node with two children: get the inorder successor
        temp = find_min(root.right)

        # Copy the inorder successor's content to this node
        root.val = temp.val

        # Delete the inorder successor
        root.right = delete_node(root.right, temp.val)

    return root

def find_min(node):
    current = node
    while current.left is not None:
        current = current.left
    return current
  </code></pre>
  <p><strong>Complexity</strong></p>
  <p>
    First we search for the node which takes maximum O(n) time. The complexity of deletion is also O(h) as we may need to search the tree again for the in-order successor. Thus, the time complexity of deleting a node from a BST is on average O(log(n)), and in the worst case, O(n). The code above is implemented using O(1) space. 
  </p>
  
  <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Binary search trees require that for each node, all nodes to the left are less than or equal to it, and all nodes to the right are greater than it.
    </li>
    <li>
      On average, lookups, insertions, and deletions in BST take O(log(n)) time.
    </li>
    <li>
      Common operations on BSTs include insertion, search, and deletion.
    </li>
    <li>
      The in-order traversal of a BST results in a sorted array.
    </li>
  </ul>
