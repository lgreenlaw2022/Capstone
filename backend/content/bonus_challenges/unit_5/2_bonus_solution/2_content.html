      alt="test case 1 input visual of grid cell values"
      style="width: 250px; height: auto"
    />
    <br />
    <p>Input:</p>
    <pre><code>grid = [
  [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],
  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
  [0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
  [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],
  [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],
  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],
  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]
]</code></pre>
    <p>
      Output: 6. The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected
      4-directionally.
    </p>
    <p>
      Input: <code>grid = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]</code><br />
      Output: 0

    <h2>Match</h2>
    <p><strong>Common solutions to graph problems:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Depth-First Search (DFS): Excellent for this problem. We can use DFS to
        explore each island completely and calculate its area.
      </li>
      <li>
        Breadth-First Search (BFS): Would also work by exploring islands level
        by level, but DFS is typically more straightforward to implement for
        area calculation.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Plan</h2>
    <p>Use a DFS approach</p>
    <ol role="list" aria-label="Solution steps">
      <li>
        Initialize a variable maxArea to track the maximum island area found
      </li>
      <li>
        Iterate through each cell in the grid
        <ol>
          <li>If the current cell is a '1' (land) and hasn't been visited</li>
          <li>Add 1 to the current islands area</li>
          <ol>
            Perform DFS from this cell to mark all connected land cells as
            visited
            <ol>
              <li>Check if the current cell is out of bounds or water</li>
              <li>Mark the current cell as visited (change '1' to '0')</li>
              <li>Recursively call DFS on the four adjacent cells</li>
              <li>Return the calculated area</li>
            </ol>
          </ol>
          <li>Update the max area</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Return the max area.</li>

    <h2>Complexity Analysis</h2>
    <p><strong>Time Complexity:</strong></p>
    <p>
      O(R x C) where R is the number of rows and C is the number of columns in
      the grid. We visit each cell in the grid at most once.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Space Complexity:</strong></p>
    <p>
      O(R x C) in the worst case for the recursion stack. This happens when the
      grid is filled with lands and DFS goes RxC levels deep.
