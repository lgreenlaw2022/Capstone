# Capstone

This repo is a senior capstone project for Minerva University. It is currently in the early stages and will be completed in Spring 2025.

### Tech stack
**Frontend**: Next.js, React.js, Typescript, CSS

**Backend**: Python (Flask), SqlAlchemy

## Project Abstract
Technical interviews are a critical step in securing a software engineering role. However, technical interview preparation resources are often fragmented and narrowly focused, lacking a cohesive program that leverages the science of learning principles. This fragmentation leads to inefficient study practices and decreased motivation among users. Further, practice resources like LeetCode questions typically focus on problem solution memorization and do not promote deep concept strategy based learning. My web application addresses these issues by centralizing a variety of study resources—including practice questions, coding challenges, and topic study guides—into a comprehensive curriculum. By integrating learning techniques such as spaced practice and interleaving, and incorporating gamification elements like points, leaderboards, and badges, the application aims to enhance user engagement and motivation. The website will utilize the principles of science of learning to foster deep and transferable knowledge, counteracting the common focus on mere problem memorization. These feature choices are also supported by research demonstrating gamification elements increase user engagement and motivation to learn. The deliverable is a full-stack website with an asynchronous learning journey that allows users to track their progress and maximize the time they have with increased enjoyment through gamification features. The ultimate goal is to elevate the efficacy and appeal of technical interview preparation through a scientifically grounded, gamified learning experience.

5. Skill journeys/pathways (“unlock” lessons with progress)
6. Personalized daily/weekly goals (includes streaks)
7. Skill badges
8. Leaderboards
9. Weekly concept reviews (review questions from all completed skills)
10. Multiple pathways through concepts
11. Gems as rewards to unlock hints and extra code challenges
